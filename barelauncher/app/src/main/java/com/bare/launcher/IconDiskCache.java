/**
 * Per-package disk cache for processed launcher icons.
 *
 * <p>Sibling of {@link AppListCache} and the {@link WallpaperController}
 * snapshot — same philosophy: persist the result of an expensive
 * pipeline so the next cold start can skip it. Where the icon
 * pipeline normally costs:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>One binder hop to {@code system_server} for
 *       {@code ResolveInfo.loadIcon} / {@code PackageManager.getActivityIcon}
 *       (~5-15 ms per icon on cheap TV ROMs).</li>
 *   <li>{@link IconRenderer#process}: AdaptiveIconDrawable layering,
 *       white-plate detection via a 12-point {@link Bitmap#getPixel} sample,
 *       circle clip + saveLayer ({@code SRC_IN}) compositing.
 *       (~5-20 ms per icon depending on icon shape.)</li>
 * </ol>
 * the cached path costs:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>One file read + {@link BitmapFactory#decodeStream} on the
 *       already-correct-resolution WEBP (~2-5 ms per icon).</li>
 * </ol>
 * Net: a 50-app cold start drops from ~500-1500 ms of icon work to
 * ~100-250 ms, all of which can run synchronously while the shelf is
 * already painted from {@link AppListCache}.
 *
 * <h3>Plug point</h3>
 * The activity calls {@link #tryRead} from inside the icon-executor
 * task body ({@code loadIconBlocking}); on a hit the bitmap goes
 * straight into the in-memory {@link android.util.LruCache} and on
 * to the cell. UI-thread callers ({@code cell.bind}, {@code preWarmIcon})
 * never touch the disk cache directly — their {@code iconCache.get}
 * checks are memory-only, and a memory miss queues the executor task
 * that runs {@link #tryRead} on a worker thread.
 *
 * <h3>Atomicity and concurrency</h3>
 * Writes go through a single-thread {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} with
 * {@code allowCoreThreadTimeOut(true)} so the writer thread exits when
 * idle. Each write goes to a {@code .tmp} sibling and renames on
 * success — process death mid-write leaves only a (best-effort
 * deleted) tmp file behind, never a half-written cache file the next
 * read would see as truncated. Reads are synchronous on the calling
 * thread (the icon executor's worker, not UI); the WEBP decode is
 * fast enough to not skip a frame.
 *
 * <h3>Resolution-keyed filenames</h3>
 * Cache filenames are {@code {pkg}-{px}.icn} where {@code px} is
 * {@code dp(ICON_DP)} at the time of the write. Including the icon's
 * pixel size in the filename makes the cache automatically self-
 * invalidate when the device DPI / font scale / display configuration
 * changes (the {@code px} value differs, so the new lookup misses and
 * a fresh decode runs at the new size). Without this, a DPI change
 * would leave previously-cached icons rendering at the OLD pixel size
 * inside cells sized at the NEW pixel size — visible as a one-pixel
 * mis-scale halo until the cache rebuilt naturally over many sessions.
 *
 * <p>The v1.4.0 first cut keyed filenames as just {@code {pkg}.cache}.
 * Those legacy entries become orphans the moment this version ships;
 * they are purged in {@link #purgeOrphans()} the first time the cache
 * is constructed under the new code so they don't accumulate disk
 * space.
 *
 * <h3>Invalidation</h3>
 * The activity's {@code packageReceiver} calls {@link #delete(String)}
 * on every {@code ACTION_PACKAGE_REPLACED} / {@code _CHANGED} /
 * {@code _REMOVED} so a package update or uninstall does not leave
 * stale icon bytes behind. {@link #delete} wildcards across every
 * resolution we may have cached for that package, so a rare boot-
 * with-larger-DPI-then-back-to-smaller-DPI session does not leak the
 * intermediate-size cache file. {@link android.util.LruCache#remove}
 * fires for the same broadcasts so the in-memory and on-disk views
 * stay in lockstep.
 *
 * <h3>Sizing</h3>
 * Typical icon WEBP at quality 95: ~3-8 KB. 50 apps → ~250 KB. 200 apps
 * → ~1 MB. No upper-bound enforcement — the cache only grows when new
 * packages are installed, and the package-removed broadcast prunes as
 * apps are uninstalled. Orphan entries from uninstall-while-launcher-
 * dead races accumulate at most a few KB each, well under any
 * reasonable disk budget. If this ever becomes a real problem, an LRU
 * sweep keyed by file mtime is one method-add away.
