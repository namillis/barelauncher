/**
 * Record describing one launchable app on the home shelf.
 *
 * <p>The identity fields ({@link #packageName}, {@link #sourceLabel},
 * {@link #component}) are immutable. {@link #label} is the effective
 * user-visible label and may be replaced by a local launcher override;
 * {@link #ri} and {@link #displayLabel} are mutable per-instance caches.
 *
 * <p>Hot-path access pattern:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #packageName} — keys for icon caches, the keymap
 *       SparseArray, the hidden-apps ArraySet, and the app-list
 *       persisted-order map.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #label} — drawn directly under each cell's icon.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #component} — fast-path launch via
 *       {@code Intent.setComponent} (skips PackageManager resolution
 *       binder hops; saves 50-200 ms per launch on slow ROMs).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #ri} — used by {@code preWarmIcon} / {@code loadIconAsync}
 *       to call {@link ResolveInfo#loadIcon}. May be {@code null} for
 *       AppInfo instances reconstructed from the on-disk
 *       {@link AppListCache} — those entries fall back to
 *       {@code PackageManager.getActivityIcon(component)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class moved out of {@link LauncherActivity} in v1.4.0 so cache
 * helpers can construct entries without reaching into an activity-owned
 * nested type. It remains package-private because only launcher internals
 * consume it.

     * already running could observe the stale {@code null} for an
     * arbitrarily long window after the upgrade and still hit the slow
     * fallback. Worst case is identical to the pre-graft behaviour
     * (slow path), but volatile makes the upgrade reliable rather than
     * timing-dependent.
