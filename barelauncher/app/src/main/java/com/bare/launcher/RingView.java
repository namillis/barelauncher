/**
 * Single-stroke selection halo that wraps the focused shelf / drawer icon.
 *
 * Visual brief: premium clean ring — no shadow, no glow, single crisp
 * stroke that hugs the icon edge with ZERO gap. As of v1.5.0 the icons are
 * TV-friendly rounded squares (see {@link IconRenderer}), so the halo is a
 * rounded-rectangle stroke whose corner radius is kept concentric with the
 * icon's corner (icon corner + half the stroke width) — the stroke's inner
 * edge sits exactly on the icon's outer edge so it reads as a halo wrapped
 * around the tile, not a separate floating frame.
 *
 * Pulled out of {@link LauncherActivity} as a top-level class so the activity
 * stays a touch smaller and the ring is independently testable. It carries
 * no implicit reference to the activity (the original was a {@code static
 * final} inner class for the same reason); position tracking is owned by
 * the activity which calls {@code setX/setY} every animation frame.
