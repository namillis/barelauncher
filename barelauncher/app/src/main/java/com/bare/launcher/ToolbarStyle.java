/**
 * Static helpers for the launcher's glass-pill toolbar buttons.
 *
 * <p>Every glyph button in the top toolbar (network, mapper, wallpaper)
 * shares the same circular plate visual language:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Idle</b> — dark glass plate (~40 % black) so the symbol reads
 *       on any wallpaper.</li>
 *   <li><b>Focused</b> — frosted near-white plate; the symbol inverts
 *       (white → near-black) so it stays legible.</li>
 *   <li>Both states carry a 1 px hairline rim that defines the plate edge.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The factories here build the exact {@link Paint} instances the buttons
 * draw with. Each call returns a <em>new</em> {@code Paint} because every
 * button has its own copy and mutates colour at draw time
 * ({@code stroke.setColor(symbolColor)}). Keeping construction here makes
 * the visual contract explicit and lets future buttons opt into the same
 * vocabulary by calling these factories instead of re-deriving them.
 *
 * <p>{@link #applyPillStyle(View)} is the focus-side counterpart:
 * round outline clipping, no platform focus rectangle, hardware layer,
 * sound effects on. Every toolbar button calls it once at construction.
 *
 * <p>This class is package-private and final. It used to live as a
 * cluster of {@code makeBtn*Paint} private methods inside
 * {@code LauncherActivity}; pulling them out drops ~70 lines from the
 * activity and makes the visual contract reusable.

     * <ul>
     *   <li>Body: filled disc at radius {@code r * 0.40}.</li>

     *       outward from the body. Each tooth is {@code r * 0.32}
     *       wide and {@code r * 0.20} long, with a corner radius of
     *       {@code toothW * 0.45} (more rounded than v1.3.3's 0.30 —
     *       reads as visibly rounded teeth at TV viewing distance,
     *       per the v1.3.4 "rounded teeth" feedback). Teeth overlap
     *       the body by 1 px so the silhouette reads as one continuous
     *       shape with no AA seam at the join.</li>
     *   <li>Hole: filled disc at radius {@code r * 0.16} drawn in
     *       {@code plateColor} so the gear reads with a central
     *       opening. The plate colour matches the pill backdrop the
     *       gear sits on (idle dark glass, focused frosted-white) so
     *       the hole reads continuous with the surrounding plate even
     *       though no actual Porter-Duff alpha-clear is performed.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Outer extent: {@code r * 0.58} including the tooth tips —
     * comfortable breathing room before the pill rim.
     *
     * <p>Allocations: zero per draw. The 6 teeth are placed via
     * {@link Canvas#save} / {@link Canvas#rotate} / {@link Canvas#restore}
     * so no scratch matrix is allocated. The caller-owned {@link Paint}
     * is reused with only its {@code color} mutated between body /
     * hole; antialias setting is preserved.
