/**
 * Encapsulates everything wallpaper-related: bitmap loading, sub-sampling,
 * cross-fade animation, recycle-on-destroy, and SharedPreferences round-trip
 * for the user-picked URI.
 *
 * <h3>Why two stacked ImageViews?</h3>
 * The wallpaper sits in two stacked {@link ImageView}s permanently at the
 * bottom of the activity's root z-order. {@code wallpaperFront} is on top
 * (always), {@code wallpaperBack} sits below. To show a new bitmap we put
 * it on BACK then fade FRONT out — the user sees the new image revealed
 * from beneath. Once the fade ends the new bitmap is copied up to FRONT,
 * FRONT alpha returns to 1, and BACK is cleared.
 *
 * <p>Roles never swap. An earlier implementation called
 * {@code bringToFront()} on the freshly-loaded view and accidentally lifted
 * a wallpaper view ABOVE the shelf / clock / buttons, hiding the entire
 * home screen. The "front is always front" invariant prevents that
 * regression by construction.
 *
 * <h3>Cold-start snapshot cache (v1.4.0)</h3>
 * A WEBP-compressed copy of the last successfully-loaded user wallpaper
 * is kept in {@code filesDir/wallpaper.snap}. The activity calls
 * {@link #loadSnapshotSync()} synchronously from {@code buildLayout},
 * before the first frame paints — the bitmap appears in the very first
 * vsync without waiting for the multi-hundred-ms ContentResolver +
 * BitmapFactory pipeline. {@link #loadStored()} is then a no-op when
 * the snapshot pre-painted (the snapshot already represents the
 * user-picked wallpaper; re-decoding the same image and cross-fading
 * over it would read as visible flicker on every cold start).
 *
 * <p>Snapshots are written ONLY on a successful {@link #applyFromUri},
 * not on {@link #loadSystem}. The system path is fast on its own
 * (WallpaperManager keeps the drawable in {@code system_server} memory,
 * the call is a binder + drawable raster, ~10-30 ms) and snapshotting
 * it would introduce a "user changed system wallpaper externally"
 * staleness window we'd then have to detect and refresh. URI snapshots
 * are bulletproof because {@link #applyFromUri} is the only writer of
 * the persisted URI: a snapshot file always corresponds to that URI.
 *
 * <h3>HARDWARE bitmap config</h3>
 * Wallpaper bitmaps are decoded as {@link Bitmap.Config#HARDWARE} so the
 * pixel data lives in graphics memory (uploaded once, drawn forever) and
 * NOT on the Java heap. A 1080p wallpaper saves ~8 MB heap; a 4K
 * wallpaper saves ~32 MB. Available since API 26 (our minSdk floor
 * exactly). The conversion runs after the snapshot is written because
 * {@code Bitmap.compress} returns false on HARDWARE bitmaps — we keep
 * the ARGB intermediate just long enough to write the snapshot, then
 * promote to HARDWARE and recycle the ARGB.
 *
 * <p>Fallback: any failure of the HARDWARE conversion (rare GPU driver
 * bug, exhausted graphic-buffer pool) returns the ARGB bitmap unchanged
 * via {@link #toHardwareOrSelf} — same observable behaviour as the
 * pre-v1.4.0 code, no regression.
 *
 * <h3>Memory hygiene</h3>
 * Wallpaper bitmaps are screen-sized. This class:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Caps decoded size at one screen of pixels (see {@link #wpDrawable}
 *       and {@link #computeSampleSize}). The pre-1.1.4 2× cap could
 *       allocate ~127 MB on a 4K panel — guaranteed OOM.</li>
 *   <li>Recycles the previous FRONT bitmap synchronously after every
 *       crossfade ends. No reliance on GC.</li>
 *   <li>Recycles both ImageViews' bitmaps explicitly on destroy.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Threading</h3>
 * One single-thread {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} (with
 * {@code allowCoreThreadTimeOut(true)}) runs all decode work, gated by
 * {@link AtomicBoolean} loading flags so a rapid sequence of "system" /
 * "user" loads cannot stack up two decodes for the same target. v1.4.0
 * switched from {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor()}
 * (which kept its worker thread alive for the activity's lifetime —
 * millions of idle cycles for a thread used only during occasional
 * wallpaper changes) to a pool that lets the worker exit after the 30 s
 * keepAlive elapses; the platform recreates it on the next submit. Same
 * discipline as {@code iconExecutor} / {@code appExecutor} in the
 * activity. Cross-fade and bitmap promotion run on the UI thread.
 *
 * <p>Pulled out of {@link LauncherActivity} so the activity stops carrying
 * the wallpaper state machine. Public surface is small and lifecycle-bound:
 * {@link #loadSnapshotSync()}, {@link #loadStored()}, {@link #applyFromUri(Uri)},
 * {@link #onConfigurationChanged(int, int)}, {@link #onDestroy()}.
