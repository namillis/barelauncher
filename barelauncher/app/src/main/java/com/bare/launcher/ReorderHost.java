 * The surface that currently owns the shared reorder context menu (the

 * ({@code AppDrawer}) can be the active reorder host at any one time — never
 * both, since the drawer is only reorder-able while it is open (covering the
 * shelf).
 *
 * <p>Introduced in v1.5.0 so the single lazily-built menu overlay
 * ({@code LauncherActivity.ensureMenuOverlay}) and its highlight logic
 * ({@code updateMenuHighlight}) can drive whichever surface is reordering
 * without hard-wiring to the shelf. The activity holds the current host in
 * {@code menuHost}; the menu's click listeners and the highlight painter call
 * through this interface instead of reaching into the shelf directly.
