# Changelog

All notable changes to BareLauncher land here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Moving between the favorites bar and app grid now follows one continuous
  path.** The selected grid surface glides from the favorites position over a
  short 220 ms eased transition and reverses the same path when returning home.
- **Wallpaper blur now fades with the grid transition.** Older TVs fade the
  cached low-resolution blur preview; Android 12+ briefly crossfades a
  GPU-blurred wallpaper copy, then returns to the existing single-layer render.
- **Grid cards stay fixed while focus changes.** Selection eases only scale and
  shadow on the card's layout position, removing the directional translation
  that made icons appear to shake. Held navigation still snaps immediately.

## [2.5.2] — 2026-09-22

### Changed

- **Favorites now sit on a Liquid Edge glass surface.** Home uses a stronger
  wallpaper blur, translucent vertical tint, and layered reflective rim; the
  mirrored favorites row in the app grid keeps the same shape with quieter
  opacity over the already-blurred wallpaper. API 26–30 uses a tiny cached
  software-blurred wallpaper preview while Android 12+ keeps live GPU blur.

### Fixed

- **App cards dim together when their context menu opens.** Reorder mode now
  commits card opacity through compositor properties in one UI transaction,
  preventing five-column and other layouts from visibly repainting cards in
  sequence while keeping the selected card bright.

## [2.5.1] — 2026-09-21

### Added

- **Focus borders are optional and customizable.** Layout settings includes a
  default-off Focus border toggle and a named high-contrast Focus color selector,
  so users can add an unmistakable remote cursor without decoding hex values.
- **Focus borders align with every app card.** The outline follows the actual
  artwork center in both the favorites bar and lower app grid.

### Changed

- **Selected app cards expand to 1.10x.** The stronger scale cue combines with
  the existing drop shadow and optional border on both favorites and the grid.

## [2.4.9] — 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **API 26 device tests wait for the launcher's final landscape activity.**
  ActivityScenario setup now follows the portrait-to-landscape recreation before
  keeping view or dialog references, so release checks cannot act on an activity
  Android has already replaced.

## [2.4.8] — 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **The app drawer still opens when an older TV compositor stalls blur capture.**
  Legacy PixelCopy preparation now has a bounded fallback that continues without
  blur and discards any late callback, so optional wallpaper polish cannot block
  D-pad navigation.

## [2.4.7] — 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **Cold-emulator release checks wait for the launcher to be ready.** Device-test
  setup now establishes home-cell focus only after the shelf can accept it, and
  smoke tests wait for non-zero content dimensions instead of treating an idle
  looper as proof that the first layout finished.

## [2.4.6] — 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **Save, Cancel, and Reset are always reachable with a TV remote.** Rename now
  marks each action explicitly focusable in touch mode when the dialog opens,
  avoiding API 26 and ROM-specific AlertDialog defaults.

## [2.4.5] — 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **Rename Save, Reset, Cancel, and Back restore launcher focus after the dialog
  closes.** Waiting for `OnDismiss` prevents the dialog window from reclaiming
  focus after the shelf or app grid has already received it.
- **Rename-dialog device tests no longer depend on context-menu animation.** The
  menu action keeps separate coverage while dialog behavior is tested directly.

## [2.4.4] — 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **D-pad Up reliably returns focus from the app grid to favorites.** BareLauncher
  restores the matching favorite immediately and reasserts it after the drawer
  fade, preventing the still-visible drawer from reclaiming focus on slower TVs.
- **Release device tests synchronize with real UI state.** Layout-settings checks
  wait for the panel, page, and persisted values, while navigation tests send the
  complete app-scoped key-event pair before checking final state.

## [2.4.3] — 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- **API 26 release validation no longer races Rename-dialog focus.** The device
  tests now wait for the dialog and actions first, then explicitly establish
  the input-focus precondition required by the keyboard tests. App behavior is
  unchanged.

## [2.4.2] — 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- **App cards now use the correct tvOS 5:3 proportions.** Favorites and the
  lower app grid render at the same 400:240 shape used by Apple TV artwork,
  across every 4–7 column layout. Existing custom artwork and layout settings
  continue to work without migration.

## [2.4.1] — 2026-09-20

### Added

- **Focused app tiles now cast a soft drop shadow.** The shadow rises with the
  existing scale animation on both the favorites bar and app grid, then clears
  completely when focus moves away.

## [2.3.3] — 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- **The on-screen keyboard closes after submitting an app or input name.**
  Pressing Done/Enter now hides the keyboard and moves focus to Save, so the
  dialog actions remain fully visible and ready for D-pad navigation.
- **The rename field has balanced spacing.** Its 24 dp horizontal margins keep
  the text box from touching the full width of the dialog on any TV density.

## [2.3.1] — 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- **Custom artwork keeps its real shape and fills the tile correctly.**
  Selected images are no longer converted into square source bitmaps.
  Transparent logos keep their alpha outline and render at nearly the full
  tile height without a white or square plate. Opaque images render
  edge-to-edge across the 5:3 tile with rounded tile corners.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-09-18

### Added

- **Custom names.** Rename any app or TV input locally from its long-press
  menu, or reset it to the name supplied by Android or the TV. Names are
  included in settings backups.
- **Custom TV-input icons.** HDMI, AV, tuner, and other input tiles now
  support Change icon and Reset icon just like installed apps.

### Fixed

- **Custom icons now fill their intended area.** Landscape and portrait
  images are center-cropped instead of being placed inside a transparent
  square, and excess transparent padding around PNG artwork is trimmed.
- **The app drawer keeps control after choosing an icon.** Refreshing one
  tile no longer rebinds the hidden favorites shelf and steals D-pad focus
  while the drawer remains visible.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Custom app icons.** Long-press any app to choose a local PNG, JPEG,
  or WebP image. BareLauncher keeps a private optimized copy, applies it
  to both launcher tiles and shortcut chips, and provides a Reset icon
  action to restore the app-provided artwork.

### What's new

- **Back up and restore your setup.** Save your layout — app order, home
  favourites, hidden apps, button shortcuts and clock style — to a file,
  and load it back later or on another TV. Find it under Settings →
  Backup & restore.
- **Wallpaper slideshow.** Under Settings → Wallpaper / Slideshow, pick a
  folder of images and have your wallpaper change on its own — every 30
  seconds up to 10 minutes, and/or a fresh one each time the TV starts.
  Picking a single wallpaper turns the slideshow off again. (Choosing a
  folder asks once for permission to read your photos.) It only runs while
  you're on the home screen, so it never slows anything down or drains
  power in the background, and your home screen still appears instantly on
  startup.
