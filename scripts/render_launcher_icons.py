# Render the legacy ic_launcher PNG fallbacks at every density.
#
# Source of truth is the vector geometry in
#   res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml
# which is designed on a 108-unit canvas. This script renders the same
# composition (deep-ink fill + rounded-square tile + stroke-only focus
# ring) at the per-density pixel sizes Android expects, with 4x super-
# sampling and Lanczos downscale for anti-aliasing quality.
#
# Square (`android:icon`) PNGs only. The round-icon fallbacks were
# dropped in v1.4.5: minSdk is 26, so every device resolves the adaptive
# icon (res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml) and the platform derives
# the round / squircle / teardrop mask from it. A separate
# `android:roundIcon` set is pure dead weight on this floor, so this
# script no longer emits it.
#
# Run from the repo root:
#   python3 scripts/render_launcher_icons.py
#
# Idempotent. No external state. Safe to re-run.
#
# Densities (px) follow the standard Android scaling ladder:
#   mdpi    48  (baseline; 1x)
#   hdpi    72  (1.5x)
#   xhdpi   96  (2x)
#   xxhdpi  144 (3x)
#   xxxhdpi 192 (4x)
